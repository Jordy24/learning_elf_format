# learning_elf_format
A simple program that can help someone who would like to start learning elf format and to do different analysis.
This code is used to demonstrate how to traverse an elf file using 'c'.
I wrote this program to make it simple to understand different aspects of an elf file and as my personal reference.
This program just traverses the sections found in the elf and just looks for the SHT_DYNSYM and prints the symbols that will be used for dynamic linking,
and also prints the names of all sections in the elf passed to it.
Once understood anything could be done since it follows the same procedure.
Enjoy
